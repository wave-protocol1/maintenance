# Delegation Strategy

A way to smartly delegate your funds to Elrond validators and 
increase decentralization, APR & security of the network. üîê


## Abstract
On the Elrond blockchain, you can delegate your funds to 
validators in order to earn rewards and secure the blockchain.

When creating a liquid staking solution, one of the most important
factors is keeping the network decentralized & the funds smartly
distributed. You don't want to put all the eggs in one basket,
especially with potentially millions of dollars worth of crypto.

One validator's APR might drop drastically over-night, they might
change the service fee for you to earn less rewards or simply
gain too much power & funds to take over the network.

To solve that issue, the delegation strategy makes sure the funds
are smartly distributed, maximizing for security of the network, APR
and a safer experience.


## How it works
The Delegation Strategy filters all validators and gives them a rating
based on 
- APR
- Decentralization (how much % of all stake it owns)
- Service fee

## Use in Wave Protocol
Wave Protocol uses the Delegation Strategy in order to contribute
to the decentralization of funds in the Elrond ecosystem and 
maximise its APR. 

The EGLD provided by users with Liquid Staking is delegated daily
based on the results of this algorithm.
